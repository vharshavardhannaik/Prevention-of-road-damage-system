## 🔧 How It Works

### Admin Workflow
```
1. Admin visits http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. Enters credentials (username/password)
3. System validates and generates JWT token
4. Redirects to dashboard
5. Admin clicks "Add New Road"
6. Fills in Road ID and Road Name
7. Submits form → Road saved to database
8. Road now available in system
```

### User Workflow
```
1. User opens http://localhost:3000
2. Clicks "Report Damage"
3. Searches for road by ID (e.g., ROAD-001)
4. System finds road added by admin
5. Shows road details
6. User files complaint
7. Complaint linked to road
```
